# Installation Directions

Extract the folders as is - into the Mods folder. The contents of the zip file have the contents stored in their correct folders so, just move the folders. There are no Mod Dll's in these folders and rely on the BTR team to update the base dependant Mods.

Delete the .modtech folder in the \Mods main folder as Call of the Locusts introduces new files for the Mods “ColourfulFlashPoints” and “Mission Control”. 

Run the modtekInjector.exe in the \ModTek folder. 

Run BattleTech. 

Hang on!
